            I thought for my last page I would share some thoughts I've had whilst completing CS50. The job I am currently in is very unmotivating with a severe lack of progression routes, and due to the fact it is also remote, it lead to me feeling very unhappy with no real sense of direction or purpose.
            One of my friends suggested that I should take on this course to try and bolster my chances of finding a new job, and I have found a new sense of confidence as the weeks have progressed. The first week came as a real eye-opener for me - I have already completed one coding course in Javascript, and therefore thought
            I would get through some of (if not most of) the course with no issues. BOY WAS I WRONG. As soon as I opened 'Mario More', I realised the level of coding was much higher than anticipated.. I'm not quite sure how I didn't think of this considering it is a Harvard course...
          </p>
          <p class="cs50-2">
            My favourite projects of this course have been all of the SQL tasks, as the logic behind how it works seems to click in my head a lot easier than other parts of the course, and the python projects, mainly readability. It was really cool to see how projects that were originally coded in 'c' could be transformed into
            a much more condensed and easy-to-read file. I have tried to keep up with learning python, learning through the website codewars (I highly recommend this to any beginner-level coder), and also sql. When the course is completed, I think I will try and apply for more jobs based around SQL due to the amount of confidence
            gained throughout this course.
          </p>
          <p class="cs50-3">
            To conclude, I would 100% recommend this course to anyone with an interest in tech. My confidence in answering questions about coding in general has rocketed, and this is solely down to this course.
